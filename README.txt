# LCSRecursiveAndDP

Longest common subsequence algorithms using recursion and dynamic programming. 

Also an example of a hash function using recursion depth from LCS recursive. Also prints out graph displaying how many collisions occurred/ how deep the chaining went within the hash map. Not meant to be used, super inefficient, but interesting.
